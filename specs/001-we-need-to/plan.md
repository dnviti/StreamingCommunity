# Implementation Plan: Refactor StreamingCommunity

**Branch**: `001-we-need-to` | **Date**: 2025-09-16 | **Spec**: [link](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-we-need-to/spec.md`

## Summary
This plan outlines the refactoring of the StreamingCommunity application from a Python-based tool to a high-performance, headless application with a Go backend and a Svelte frontend. The primary goal is to replicate all functionalities of the old project, including support for all previously supported websites, video players, and download protocols, while improving performance, maintainability, and user experience.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Go (latest), Svelte (latest)
**Primary Dependencies**: Gin (Go web framework), SvelteKit, colly (Go scraping framework), goja (Go JavaScript interpreter), anacrolix/torrent (Go torrent client).
**Storage**: JSON file
**Testing**: Go testing library, Vitest/Playwright for Svelte
**Target Platform**: Linux server
**Project Type**: Web application
**Performance Goals**: Faster than the current Python implementation.
**Constraints**: Simple and clean code, must support all features of the old project.
**Scale/Scope**: Small to medium user base (up to 1000 concurrent users), moderate amount of data (up to 1GB JSON file).

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

[ ] The project structure follows the web application model (backend/frontend).
[ ] The technology choices (Go, Svelte) are justified by the performance and maintainability requirements.
