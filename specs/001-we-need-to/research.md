# Research Findings: Refactor StreamingCommunity to a Web Application

## Storage
- **Decision**: Continue using existing JSON files for data storage (downloads.json, videos.json, websites.json).
- **Rationale**: To maintain consistency with the existing project and simplify the initial refactoring effort. The Go backend will be responsible for managing these JSON files.
- **Alternatives considered**: Relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL), NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB). These were not chosen for the initial phase to minimize complexity and leverage existing data structures. They may be considered in future iterations for scalability.

## Performance Goals
- **Decision**: Not yet defined.
- **Rationale**: The feature specification did not include specific performance targets.
- **Alternatives considered**: N/A. This will require further discussion with stakeholders to define acceptable response times, throughput, etc.

## Scale/Scope
- **Decision**: Not yet defined.
- **Rationale**: The feature specification did not include specific scale or scope requirements (e.g., number of concurrent users, data volume).
- **Alternatives considered**: N/A. This will require further discussion with stakeholders to understand the expected user base and data growth.
