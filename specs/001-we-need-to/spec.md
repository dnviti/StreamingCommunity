# Feature Specification: Refactor StreamingCommunity to a Web Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-we-need-to`  
**Created**: 2025-09-16  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "We need to refactor this StreamingCommunity application useful for video download from various websites in order to make it less crappy, completely headless cli, we need to maintain all functionalities about the supported websites. The goal is to download movies, tv shows and animes, read the code to understand what has been done here, even if the code is complete garbage"

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to use a web interface to download videos (movies, TV shows, animes) from various supported websites, so that I can easily manage downloads and use the application through a graphical user interface.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1.  **Given** a movie title, **When** I search for the title through the web interface, **Then** the movie is downloaded to my local machine.
2.  **Given** a TV show title, **When** I search for the title through the web interface, **Then** all episodes of the TV show are downloaded.
3.  **Given** an anime series title, **When** I search for the title through the web interface, **Then** all episodes of the anime are downloaded.
4.  **Given** a Crunchyroll anime series title, **When** I search for the title through the web interface, **Then** all episodes of the anime are downloaded, handling DRM correctly.
5.  **Given** a search query, **When** I use the global search through the web interface, **Then** I get a list of results from all supported websites.
6.  **Given** an invalid title, **When** I search for the title through the web interface, **Then** an error message is displayed.
7.  **Given** an unsupported website title, **When** I search for the title through the web interface, **Then** an error message is displayed.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a download is interrupted?
- How does the system handle websites that require a login or a premium account?
- How does the system handle content that is region-locked?
